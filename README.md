# Artificial Neural Network to Predict Concrete Strength
In this machine learning project,  my role as a data analyst involved:

* Conducted comprehensive data preprocessing tasks including duplicate data checking, handling missing values, and removing outliers to ensure data cleanliness and suitability for analysis and modeling.
* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the characteristics and distribution of the dataset, identifying patterns and relationships between variables.
* Utilized various data visualization techniques, such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots, to visualize data patterns and characteristics, aiding in understanding and interpretation.
* Analyzed the results of the developed and tested models to draw conclusions and insights, evaluating model performance and identifying areas for improvement.
